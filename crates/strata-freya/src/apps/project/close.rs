//! T2 — the close-while-running *mechanics*. One predicate, one dialog, three triggers:
//! the OS close (red button, vetoed via the fork's `on_close` hook), ⌘Q / menu Quit
//! (`Command::CloseProject` / `MenuCmd::Quit`), and any single-tab close of the tab
//! whose query is in flight ([`TabCloser`]). The dialog itself is
//! `crate::apps::project::views::dialogs::CloseConfirm`.
//!
//! The `on_close` hook runs on the winit thread outside any component scope and must be
//! `Send`, so the window bridges it with atomics ([`CloseGuard`], mirrored from reactive
//! state by `use_side_effect`s) plus an unbounded channel: the hook reads the guard
//! synchronously, and on veto sends a ping that wakes the UI executor, which flips the
//! `State<Option<CloseTarget>>` and renders the dialog. "Close anyway" then closes
//! programmatically via `close_current_window()`, which bypasses the veto.
